# SR-Extractor
Extractor for .SR archives from Sega Genesis Collection on PlayStation 2

### Who
I made the script. Sega made the game collection.
### What
Sega Genesis Collection stores its assets in an archive format with the .SR extension. Let's pretend that SR stand for "Sega aRchive."
### When
Started the night of September 5, 2018 and robustified the following two days.
### Where
My house, the Internet, my mind
### Why
The game has nice menu music that can't be found outside of compressed YouTube rips. I wanted that music.
### How
To use: select a .SR archive file and click the extract button. A folder named after the archive will be created with the archive's contents.


## Todo
* The .ICO file has some of the proper ICO header. Figure out what's wrong
* Mass archive extraction
* Figure out .IA format. The first 10 bytes seem to be an identical header
